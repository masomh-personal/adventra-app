# Sprint 2 Story Point Forecast

## Forecast

Our team forecasts 42 story points to be completed during Sprint 2.

---

## Rationale

### 1. Team Velocity

Last sprint, we successfully completed our goal of 16 story points while also handling several foundational tasks. For Sprint 2, we expect to be more focused and productive, which should allow us to achieve a higher output.

---

### 2. Team Capacity

- All 5 team members are available for the entire sprint
- No known scheduling conflicts

---

### 3. Story Complexity

The planned stories for this sprint include foundational tasks (e.g., entity creation and database design) and initial implementation of website pages.

We have estimated the following:

- 1 story at 1 point
- 2 stories at 2 points each
- 4 stories at 3 points each
- 5 stories at 5 points each

Total planned: 42 points

---

### 4. Risks & Assumptions

- Increasing the number of story points raises the risk of not completing every planned item
- Assumes full team availability throughout the sprint
- Some foundational tasks may reveal unexpected complexity

---

## Summary

Based on our current velocity, team capacity, and the scope of planned stories, we are confident in our forecast of 42 story points for Sprint 2.
